	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a measure of how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of its input increases. It is an abstract way to represent the efficiency of an algorithm, focusing on the rate of growth rather than the exact execution time, which can vary based on factors like hardware, operating system, and compiler.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measure of the amount of memory an algorithm requires to execute and complete its task, expressed in terms of the size of the input. O(n) indicates linear space (memory usage grows proportionally to the input size), and O(n^2) indicates quadratic space.</p>
